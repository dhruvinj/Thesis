 \section{Review of Theory}
 
-The growth of computations technology has enabled uncertainity quantification for complex engineering problems. If we  incorporate data into a model, the quantification of uncertainty of complex can be achieved. Bayes' formula provides the natural way to infer the necessary uncertainty information. Mathematical model governing physical phenomenon often include parameters that need to be determined from experiments. To estimate parameters, we must make assumptions about the noise levels, models, and prior knowledge. Let $y$ be the data which is dependent on independent parameter $u$. 
-
-$$y = G(u)$$. 
-
-\noindent  In Bayesian approach, $u$ is treated as random variable with some specified prior probability distribution that incorporates any prior knowledge about $u$ that we believe is true and is independent of the measured data $y$. The solution of the inverse problem is the probability distribution of u given y, denoted by $u|y$. The Bayes' formula is given as 
-
-$$P(u|y) = \frac{P(u) P(y|u)}{P(y)}$$ .
- 
- \bigskip
- 
-\noindent Where $P(u)$ is the prior probability distribution of $u$. $P(y|u)$ is the likelihood of $y$ given $u$. $P(y)$ is the scaling factor. 
- \noindent The result is the posterior probability distribution of $P(u|y)$.
- 
-$$P(u|y) = \frac{P(u) P(y|u)}{P(y)}$$ .
+The growth of computations technology has enabled uncertainity
+quantification for complex engineering problems. If we incorporate the
+inevitable uncertainty present in experimental
+data into the calibration of our models, the quantification of
+uncertainty of complex models can be
+achieved. Bayes' formula provides a natural foundation on which to
+base such a calibration procedure.

+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \mathbf{y} = G(\mathbf{m})
+\end{equation}
+%
+  In the Bayesian approach, $\mathbf{m}$ is treated as random variable with some
+  specified prior probability distribution that incorporates any prior
+  knowledge about $\mathbf{m}$ that we believe is true. The solution of the inverse problem is the

+  %
+  \begin{equation}
+    P(\mathbf{m}|\mathbf{y}) = \frac{P(\mathbf{m}) P(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{m})}{P(\mathbf{y})}
+  \end{equation}

+ where $P(\mathbf{m})$ is the prior probability distribution, $P(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{m})$
+ is the likelihood distribution, and $P(\mathbf{y})$ is the scaling factor.
+ The result is the posterior probability distribution of $P(\mathbf{m}|\mathbf{y})$.
 
 \section{Methods of Solution}
 
-\noindent We use markov chain monte carlo method for estimating the posterior distribution by simulations. Markov chain is formed from successive random selections, the stationary distribution of which is the target distribution. In the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, samples are selected from an arbitrary “proposal” distribution and are retained or not according to an acceptance rule. 
-
+In only the simplest of circumstances is an analytical solution
+possible. Otherwise, we must resort to numerical solution.
+ We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for estimating the posterior
+ distribution by repeated sampling of our forward model. In the
+ present work, the forward model is a numerical simulation of
+ one-dimensional flames. A Markov Chain is formed from successive
+ random selections, the stationary distribution of which is the target
+ distribution. In the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, samples are
+ selected from an arbitrary “proposal” distribution and are retained
+ or not according to an acceptance rule~\cite{RobertCasella2004}.
+
+ Furthermore, because of the heavy sampling burden, even ``fast''
+ models may be challening to leverage within an MCMC sampler. Thus,
+ one often resorts to so-called surrogate models where instead of
+ computing with the ``full model'' directly, we use a surrogate that
+ is constructed ahead of time, but that can be evaluated very
+ quickly. For the present work, we use simple linear Lagrange
+ interpolation over the parameter space. While this strategy is not
+ effective in high parameter dimensions, due the rapid growth of the
+ number of function evaluations required, for small dimensional
+ problems, the strategy is easy and effective.
+
+ We heavily leverage the QUESO C++ software package~\cite{QUESO} for the
+ development of the the statistical surrogate as well as the MCMC
+ sampling. In particular, we use Metropolis-Hastings MCMC; the QUESO
+ library deploys the so-called Delayed Rejection Adaptive Monte Carlo
+ (DRAM) sampling strategy~\cite{DRAM}. Our interface consists of a
+ simple wrapper class around the Cantera solver for representing the
+ $G(\mathbf{m})$ map for which we can then easily plugin to the array
+ of algorithms available in QUESO, including the surrogate
+ construction and the MCMC sampling.
 
 \section{Application to Ozone Combustion}
 
-\noindent We have the experimental data for flamespeed from Streng \cite{Streng}. Our goal is to do uncertainty quantification for chemical parameters namely Activation Energy $ E $ and pre exponential factor $ A $ for all the three reactions involved in the ozone oxygen combustion model. We first did sensitivity analysis for flamespeed based on all the chemical parameters. We found that the activation energy and the pre exponential factor for the first reaction of the mechanism did not have significant effect on the flamespeed. Hence moving further, we would not consider these parameters as uncertain. The remaining 4 parameters i.e Activation Energy and pre exponential factors for second and third reactions were highly sensitive to the flame speed calcualtions. The Acivation energy for the third reaction was most sensitive. We will approach to the uncertainty quantification problem step by step with different models.  
-
-\noindent Let us denote flamespeed by $V_f$, the activation energy for second and third reaction for mechanism as $E_2$ and $E_3$ respectively and the pre exponential factor as $A_2$ and $A_3$ recpectively. 
+ We have the experimental data for flamespeed from Streng
+ \cite{Streng}, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:ozone-data}.
+ Our goal is the inference of
+ chemical parameters for the Ozone mechanism described in
+ Equation~\eqref{eq:ozone-mech}. For this mechanism, each of the
+ reaction rates is of the Arrhenius form described in
+ Equation~\eqref{eq:arrhenius}.
+ Thus, the parameters of interest are the
+ activation energy $E$ and the
+ pre-exponential factor $A$ for all three reactions involved in the
+ ozone combustion model. Since we are only considering variation in
+ the chemical kinetics, we are implicitly assuming that all other
+ approximations are valid, namely the conservation, transport, and
+ thermodynamic models. Further, we are assuming adequate numerical
+ resolution of the solutions and convergence of the iterative methods.
+
+ First, a rudimentary sensitivity analysis was performed to identify
+ those parameters to which the laminar flame speed, denoted $V_f$, was most
+ sensitive. Then, based on those results, we construct several
+ statistical models on which we perform Bayesian inference. That is,
+ each statistical model may consider differing priors, likelihoods,
+ and uncertain parameters; however, the experimental data is the
+ same. Those parameters that are not treated as uncertain are held
+ fixed at nominal values.
+
+ In all cases,
+the prior is uniform, which differing bounds for each model, and the
+likelihood is assumed Gaussinan. In~\cite{Streng}, no indication is
+given on the error associated with each of the measured laminar flame
+speeds. Thus, we assume that the error is zero mean with a standard
+deviation 10\% of the data value for each of the reported laminar
+flame speeds. Further, we assume that each of the measurements is
+independent. Therefore, the likelihood function will take the form
+%
+\begin{equation}
+P(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{m}) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^d \sqrt{|\Sigma|}}
+\exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2}\left(G(\mathbf{m}) -
+  \mathbf{y}\right)^T\Sigma^{-1} \left(G(\mathbf{m}) -
+  \mathbf{y}\right) \right]
+\end{equation}
+%
+where $d$ is the dimension of the data and the covariance matrix, $\Sigma$, is diagonal.
+We use the five data points reported in Table~\ref{tab:ozone-flame-data}.
+Thus, in all cases, $d = 5$ and the vector $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^5$.

-The results displayed in this section are for the uncertainty involved in the calculation of flamespeed depending only on one parameter i.e the activation energy for the fall off reaction in the ozone mechanism. The percentage of ozone is taken as 40,46,53,75 and 100  percent acccording to the experimental data available to us from Streng\cite{Streng}.The results are displayed in five sections. In first section, the plots are shown for raw chain size, histogram, CDF and log likelihood for parameter $E_3$. In second section, for constant surrogate size, the number of samples are changed from 1e5 to 1e7 and convergence is observed. In the third part of the results, convergence study is done for surrogates with different sizes. In fourth section, we ensure that samples of the parameter which we are drawing are fitting the flamespeed values of the experiment. Also for varying size the map point of the resulting pdf does not change greatly. In the fifth section mean and correlation plots are shown for the samples of the parameter. The surrogates for individual concentrations are constructed using linear interpolation function. The initial guess for the map point is calculated using nelder mead optimization technique. After supplying initial guess over large domain it is found that the map point is the same no matter where we start our guess.

 \section{Model 2: $E_2$ and $E_3$}
 
-The results displayed in this section are for the uncertainty involved in the calculation of flamespeed depending  on two parameter i.e the activation energy for the fall off reaction in the ozone mechanism and activation energy for second reaction in the mechanism. The percentage of ozone is taken as 40,46,53,75 and 100  percent acccording to the experimental data available to us from Streng\cite{Streng}.The results are displayed in five sections. In first section, the plots are shown for raw chain size, histogram, and CDF for parameters $E_3$ and $E_2$. In second section, for constant surrogate size, the number of samples are changed from 1e5 to 1e7 and convergence is observed. In the third part of the results, convergence study is done for surrogates with different sizes. In fourth section, we ensure that samples of the parameter which we are drawing are fitting the flamespeed values of the experiment. In the fifth section mean and correlation plots are shown for the samples of both the parameters. The surrogates for individual concentrations are constructed using linear interpolation function. The initial guess for the map point is calculated using nelder mead optimization technique. After supplying initial guess over large domain it is found that the map point is the same no matter where we start our guess.

 \section{Sensitivity study}
 
-\noindent First we started with sensivity study of the chemical parameters. We change the values of pre exponential factor and activation energy for all three reactions by $\pm$ 100 $\% $ and run our forward model and note the values of flamespeed obtained. We repeat this activity for 40, 46, 53, 75 and 100 $\%$ ozone cases. For all the concentrations, it is seen that the variation of flamespeed with around 0.5 $\%$ for the pre exponential and activation energy got first reaction of the mechanism. The variation of pre expoenntial factor of the second reaction and thrid reactions for all the concentrations has significant change of flamespeed values. The most sensitive parameters among all the four parameters is the activation energy for the thrid reaction of the mechanism where the change of more than $\pm 200\%$ is observed in flame speed.

-\noindent Going further we would not consider the uncertainties involved in the chemical parameters of the first reaction. We would consider the remaining four parameters for our study.

 \subsection{Different surrogate sizes }
 
-\noindent Here the surrogate size is defined as $sample size*2$ matrix. The flamespeed is calculated for given samples in the domain ( -10 to 40) for $E_2$ and in the domain ( -10 to 40) for $E_3$. Other values are calculated as linear interpolation of these 1000 points. In this analysis, raw chain size of $1e5$, $5e5$ , $1e6$, $5e6$ and $1e7$ is taken.

 \subsection{Convergence Study }
 
-\noindent In this section, we see the convergence of the probability distribution as we increase the raw chain sample size. The plot is done for surrogate size of 100. In this analysis, raw chain size of $1e5$, $5e5$ , $1e6$, $5e6$ and $1e7$ is taken.

 \subsection{flamespeed Data fit}
 
-\noindent It is necessary to ensure that the samples of the parameters which we are drawing are fitting the flamespeed values of the experimental. In this section, we calculate the flamespeed for all the parameters drawn using the surrogate generated before. We have taken $1e7$ sample size and calculated flamespeed for different concentrations of ozone.
