\section{Estimating parameters Activation energies for reaction 2  and 3  }

The results displayed in this section are for the uncertainty involved in the calculation of flamespeed depending on two parameters i.e the activation energy for the fall off reaction and activation energy for reaction 2 in the ozone mechanism. The percentage of ozone is taken  20,28,40,46,53,75 and 100  percent acccording to the experimental data available to us from Streng\cite{Streng}.The results are dispalyed in three section. In first section, for constant surrogate size, the number of samples are changes. In the second part of the results, convergence study is done for all samples with surrogate size 100*100. In third section, we ensure that samples of the parameters which we are drawing are fitting the flamespeed values of the experiment. Also for varying size the map point of the resulting pdf does not change greatly. The surrogates for individual concentrations are constructed using linear interpolation function. The initial guess for the map point is calculated using nelder mead optimization technique. After supplying initial guess over large domain it is found that the map point is the same no matter where we start our guess.

\subsection{Different surrogate sizes }

 Here the surrogate size is defined as $sample size*2$ matrix. The flamespeed is calculated for given samples in the domain ( -10 to 40) for $E_2$ and in the domain ( -10 to 40) for $E_3$. Other values are calculated as linear interpolation of these 1000 points. In this analysis, raw chain size of $1e5$, $5e5$ , $1e6$, $5e6$ and $1e7$ is taken.

\subsection{Convergence Study }

 In this section, we see the convergence of the probability distribution as we increase the raw chain sample size. The plot is done for surrogate size of 100. In this analysis, raw chain size of $1e5$, $5e5$ , $1e6$, $5e6$ and $1e7$ is taken.

\subsection{flamespeed Data fit}

 It is necessary to ensure that the samples of the parameters which we are drawing are fitting the flamespeed values of the experimental. In this section, we calculate the flamespeed for all the parameters drawn using the surrogate generated before. We have taken $1e7$ sample size and calculated flamespeed for different concentrations of ozone.
