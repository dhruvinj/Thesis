\section{Sensitivity study}

\noindent First we started with sensivity study of the chemical parameters. We change the values of pre exponential factor and activation energy for all three reactions by $\pm$ 100 $\% $ and run our forward model and note the values of flamespeed obtained. We repeat this activity for 40, 46, 53, 75 and 100 $\%$ ozone cases. For all the concentrations, it is seen that the variation of flamespeed with around 0.5 $\%$ for the pre exponential and activation energy got first reaction of the mechanism. The variation of pre expoenntial factor of the second reaction and thrid reactions for all the concentrations has significant change of flamespeed values. The most sensitive parameters among all the four parameters is the activation energy for the thrid reaction of the mechanism where the change of more than $\pm 200\%$ is observed in flame speed. 

\noindent Going further we would not consider the uncertainties involved in the chemical parameters of the first reaction. We would consider the remaining four parameters for our study.
