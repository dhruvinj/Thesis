\section{Review of Theory}

In various sciences and engineering fields, uncertainity quantification problems arise. If we  incorporate data into a model, significant reduction in uncertainty of model prediction is acheived and hence a very important step in many applicaiton. Bayes' formula provides the natural way to do this. Mathematical model governing physical phenomenon often include parameters that need to be determined from experiments by measuring them with the help of devices. The measures values of the parameters have uncertainty in them depending upon the assumptions, noise levels, models and prior knowledge. To estimate the correct values of the parameters we should make assumptions about the noise levels, models and prior knowledge. Let $y$ be the data which is dependent on $u$. 

$$y = G(u)$$. 

\noindent The solution of the inverse problem is the probability distribution of u given y, denoted by $u|y$. The Bayes' formula is given as 

$$P(u|y) = \frac{P(u) P(y|u)}{P(y)}$$ .
 
 \bigskip
 
\noindent Where $P(u)$ is the prior probability distribution of $u$. $P(y|u)$ is the likelihood of $y$ given $u$. $P(y)$ is the scaling factor. 
 \noindent In Bayesian approach, $u$ is treated as random variable with some specified prior probability distribution that incorporates any prior knowledge about $u$ that we believe is true and is independent of the measured data $y$. The result is the posterior probability distribution of $u$ conditional on $y$. The likelihood and prior are selected as per (â€¦........) .
