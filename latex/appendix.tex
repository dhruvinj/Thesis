\chapter{Appendix}

\noindent This works shows the asymptotic anaylsis of Navier stokes equation which was developed by Muller\cite{Muller}. It is shown by Muller~\cite{Muller} that a multiple-time scale, single-space scale asymptotic analysis of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations reveals that the zeroth-order global thermodynamic pressure, the divergence of velocity; and the material change of density are affected by heat-release rate and heat conduction at low-Mach-numbers.
