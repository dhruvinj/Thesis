\section{Motivation}
It is important to understand the dynamics of reacting flows as it is
inherent in a number of areas of science and engineering. These areas include
combustion, surface chemistry, and reentry flows. To understand these
systems in detail, it is necessary to use numerical simulations of
complex mathematical models. These
simulations require simultaneous numerical resolution of chemical
reactions, diffusive transport, and fluid mechanics. The combination
of these three factors make simulations demanding of computational
resources. The problem is acute in the deflagration regime where the
burning speed, also known as laminar flame speed, and associated
velocity scales are much smaller than the speed of sound in the fluid.

For low speed combustion flows, low Mach number asymptotic
of the flow equations exploit the inherent separation of scales in
such systems by analytically eliminating acoustic wave propagation
entirely from the dynamics, while preserving the important
compressibility effects arising from reactions and transport.

These mathematical models of combustion inevitably contain unknown
parameters that must be calibrated against experimental
data. Traditionally, optimization approaches have been used to
determine the values of these parameters. However,
such deterministic approaches fail to incorporate information about
the uncertainty in the data. Bayesian inference provides a systematic
framework to infer such parameters from the observed data and, in
particular, provides a systematic approach to incorporate uncertainty.
In this work, we aim at performing Bayesian inference for chemical
parameters in an ozone combustion model. Experiments~\cite{Streng} have
successfully measured the flame speed for premixed ozone-oxygen at
various concentrations starting from 17 percent mole fraction to 100 percent
mole fraction of ozone. We use this data to infer the
parameters in a ozone combustion model. In the Bayesian approach, we take
into consideration our prior knowledge about the parameters and the
likelihood of observing the data given the parameters. The resulting
answer is the probability distribution of the parameters given the
data.

Chapter~\ref{chap:model} describes the mathematical model for low speed
chemically reacting flows. One-dimensional models are subsequently described.
Further, transport models are described that are used to evaluate
transport properties of the chemical mixture and close the model equations.
Finally, the ozone combustion model and the experimental data are
described.
Chapter~\ref{chap:bayes} gives an overview
Bayesian inference and the solution of statistical inverse problems.
The various model classes used for inference
analysis are described.
Chapter~\ref{chap:results} shows the results of the Bayesian inference
for the various model classes considered.
Chapter~\ref{chap:fem} describes a finite element formulation of the
axisymmetric two-dimensional equations that can be used to simulate
two-dimensional premixed laminar flames. Stabilization techniques are
described. We describe how such formulations lay the foundation for future
endeavors in Bayesian inference for chemical parameters based on
two-dimensional laminar flame data.
