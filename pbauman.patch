 \noindent This works shows the asymptotic anaylsis of Navier stokes equation which was developed by Muller\cite{Muller}. It is shown by Muller~\cite{Muller} that a multiple-time scale, single-space scale asymptotic analysis of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations reveals that the zeroth-order global thermodynamic pressure, the divergence of velocity; and the material change of density are affected by heat-release rate and heat conduction at low-Mach-numbers.
+It is shown by Muller~\cite{Muller} that a multiple-time scale, single-space scale asymptotic analysis of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations reveals that the zeroth-order global thermodynamic pressure, the divergence of velocity; and the material change of density are affected by heat-release rate and heat conduction at low-Mach-numbers.

+\noindent His result show that the acoustic time change of the heat-release rate as the dominant source of sound in low-Mach-number flow. The asymptotic expansion of all flow variables show that the viscous and buoyancy forces enter the computation of the second-order incompressible pressure in low-Mach-number flow in a similar way as they enter the pressure computation in incompressible flow, except that the
+velocity-divergence constraint is non zero. He averaged flow equation over an acoustic wave period, the averaged velocity tensor described the net acoustic effect on the averaged flow field. Once acoustics were removed from the equations altogether it lead to the low-Mach-number equations.
+
+\bigskip
+\noindent The incompressibility assumption makes the problem simpler than if a full compressible flow is considered. Codine  proposed that for ideal fluids, with isentropic condition, solutions of the incompressible Navier Stokes equations can be found as the limit of solutions of the compressible ones as the Mach number tends to zero under certain assumptions on the initial data.
+
+\noindent In this paper, they showed that small Mach number limit gives rise to a separation of the pressure into a constant-in-space thermodynamic pressure and a mechanical pressure that has to be used in the momentum equation. This leads to a removal of the acoustic modes and the flow behaves as incompressible, in the sense that the mechanical pressure is determined by the mass conservation
+equation and not by the state equation. However, large variations of density
+due to temperature variations are allowed. They showed that when the Mach number is small the hyperbolic wave equation for the pressure becomes an elliptic
+equation for the first order pressure p(2), thus showing the implicit (“incompressible” or “mechanical”) character of this pressure component.

If we  incorporate data into a model, the quantification of uncertainty of complex can be achieved. Bayes' formula provides the natural way to infer the necessary uncertainty information. Mathematical model governing physical phenomenon often include parameters that need to be determined from experiments. To estimate parameters, we must make assumptions about the noise levels, models, and prior knowledge. Let $y$ be the data which is dependent on independent parameter $u$.

 \noindent We have the experimental data for flamespeed from Streng \cite{Streng}. Our goal is to do uncertainty quantification for chemical parameters namely Activation Energy $ E $ and pre exponential factor $ A $ for all the three reactions involved in the ozone oxygen combustion model. We first did sensitivity analysis for flamespeed based on all the chemical parameters. We found that the activation energy and the pre exponential factor for the first reaction of the mechanism did not have significant effect on the flamespeed. Hence moving further, we would not consider these parameters as uncertain. The remaining 4 parameters i.e Activation Energy and pre exponential factors for second and third reactions were highly sensitive to the flame speed calcualtions. The Acivation energy for the third reaction was most sensitive. We will approach to the uncertainty quantification problem step by step with different models.

+\chapter{Mathematical Models for Combustion}\label{chap:model}
+
+Mathematicals models for predicting combustion phenomena stem from the
+from the compressible, reacting, Navier-Stokes equations~\cite{PoinsotVeynante3ed}. In absence
+of dominant acoustic phenomena, an asymptotic analysis yields the low
+Mach number approximation that is very typical in combustion
+modeling~\cite{Muller,Codina,PoinsotVeynante3ed,Kuo} --- this system of partial differential equations is
+described in Section~\ref{sec:lowmach}. Appendix~\ref{chap:app}
+illustrates the asymptotic analysis for the non-reacting equations. One-dimensional models are
+also frequently used for studying freely propagating flames --- these
+models are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:1d}. Such
+scenarios arise are commonly used experimentally for measuring laminar
+speeds in experiments~\cite{}.
+
+\section{Governing Equations}\label{sec:lowmach}
+
+Given a multicomponent gas over the domain of interest, we make the
+following assumptions: the gas can be modeled as a continuum, the
+ideal gas law is applicable and valid, the gas behaves as a Newtonian
+fluid, the thermodynamic pressure
+is constant (follows from the low Mach number assumption), the Dufor
+effect is neglible (energy transport due to mass fraction gradients),
+the Soret effect is neglible (mass transport due to thermal
+gradient), and radiative heating is negligible. Then, the following system of partial differential
+equations holds~\cite{PoinsotVeynante3ed}:
 
+\begin{equation}
+\begin{aligned}
+\nabla \cdot \bu &= \frac{1}{T}\frac{DT}{Dt} - \frac{1}{M}\frac{DM}{dt} \\ %- \frac{1}{p^0} \frac{dp^0}{dt} \\
+\rho \frac{D Y_s}{D t} &= \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{j}_s + \dot{\omega}_s \quad s = 1 \dots N_s \\
+\rho \frac{D\bu}{Dt} &= -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\tau} + \rho \boldsymbol{g} \\
+\rho c_p \frac{DT}{Dt} %- \frac{dp^0}{dt}
+&= \nabla \cdot \left(k \nabla T \right) - \sum_s h_s \dot{\omega_s} -
+\nabla T  \cdot \left( \sum_{s} c_{p,s} \boldsymbol{j}_s \right) +
+\sum_{s} \rho \boldsymbol{g} \cdot \boldsymbol{j}_s \\
+%\frac{dp^0}{dt} \int_{\Omega} \frac{1}{\gamma - 1} \; d\mathbf{x} &= -p^0 \int_{\Omega} \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} \; d
+%\mathbf{x} + \int_{\partial \Omega} k \nabla T \cdot \mathbf{n} \; dS \\
+p^0 &= \rho R T
+\end{aligned}
+\end{equation}
+where $\bu$ is the mixtured averaged velocity of the gas, $T$ is the temperature of the
+gas, $M$ is the mixture molar mass, $\rho$ is the mixture density,
+$Y_s$ is the mass fraction of species $s$ with a total of $N_s$ species, $\boldsymbol{j}_s$ is the
+mass diffusion flux of species $s$, $\dot{\omega}_s$ is the mass of
+species $s$ generated due to chemical reactions, $p$ is the
+hydrostatic pressure, $\tau$ is the viscous stress tensor,
+$\boldsymbol{g}$ is acceleration due to gravity, $c_p$ is the mixture
+specific heat, $k$ is the mixture thermal conductivity, $h_s$ is the
+enthalpy of the gas, $c_{p,s}$ is the specific heat of species $s$,
+$p^0$ is the thermodynamic pressure, and $R$ is the gas constant of
+the mixture.
+
+The species mass fraction $Y_s$ is defined as
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  Y_s = \frac{\rho_s}{\rho}
+\end{equation}
+%
+where $\rho_s$ is the density of species $s$.
+The mixture molar mass $M$ is given as
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \frac{1}{M} = \sum_{s=1}^{N_s} \frac{Y_i}{M_i}
+\end{equation}
+%
+where $M_i$ is the molar mass of species $i$.
+%
+For a Newtonian fluid, the viscous stress tensor is given as
+%
+\begin{equation}\label{eq:stress_tensor}
+  \tau = \mu\left(\nabla\bu + \nabla^{T}\bu\right) -\frac{2}{3}\mu \left(\nabla\cdot\bu\right)\boldsymbol{I}
+\end{equation}
+%
+where $mu$ is the viscosity of the gas mixture.
+%
+Species thermodynamic quantities are computed using table lookup from the NASA
+CEA tables~\cite{CEATables}.
+Mixture quanties are then just a sum of the species
+quantity weighted by the species mass fraction, e.g.
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  c_p = \sum_{s=1}^{N_s} Y_s c_{p,s}
+\end{equation}
+%
 
-\section{Governing Equations}
+The discussion of the mass diffusion flux follows that of~\cite{Kee}.
+The species mass diffusion flux, $\boldsymbol{j}_s$, is defined in terms
+of the species diffusion velocity, $\boldsymbol{V}_s$. In particular,
+let $\tilde{\boldsymbol{V}}_s$ be the average velocity of species $s$
+relative to a fixed reference frame. Then, the mixture averaged
+velocity, $\bu$, is
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \bu = \sum_{s=1}^{N_s} Y_s \tilde{\boldsymbol{V}}_s
+\end{equation}
+%
+and the species velocity, $\boldsymbol{V}_s$, is
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \boldsymbol{V}_s = \tilde{\boldsymbol{V}}_s - \bu
+\end{equation}
+%
+Then, then mass diffusion flux is
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \boldsymbol{j}_s = \rho_s \left( \tilde{\boldsymbol{V}}_s - \bu
+  \right) = \rho Y_s \boldsymbol{V}_s
+\end{equation}
+%
+We assume a Fick's law relationship for the mass diffusion flux
+$\boldsymbol{j}_s$. For the ``full multicomponent'' model, this yields
+a coupled system of equations to solve at every point in
+space. Instead, for computational simplicity, we assume a
+``mixture-averaged'' model. The primary assumption here is that
+species velocity is the \emph{same} for every species, i.e.
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \boldsymbol{V}_j - \boldsymbol{V}_k = 0, \quad j \ne k
+\end{equation}
+%
+Under this assumption, the mass diffusion flux is
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \boldsymbol{j}_s = -\rho D_s \nabla Y_s
+\end{equation}
+%
+where
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \frac{1}{D_s} = \sum_{t\ne s} \frac{X_t}{\mathcal{D}_{st}} +
+  \frac{X_s}{1-Y_s} \sum_{t\ne s} \frac{Y_t}{\mathcal{D}_{st}}
+\end{equation}
+%
+where $\mathcal{D}_{st}$ are the binary diffusion coefficients between
+species $s$ and $t$ and $X_s$ is the mole fraction of species $s$. The
+construction of the binary diffusion coefficents is discussed in
+Section~\ref{sec:species-trans}
 
 
-The final equations obtained by from asymptotic analysis is given below.

--\nabla \cdot u &=& \frac{1}{p^0} \frac{d p^0}{d t} - \frac{1}{T}\frac{D T}{D t} \hspace{1mm}\\

-\end{eqnarray}
+The remaining mixture transport properties are computed using the
+Wilke mixing rule~\cite{Wilke} based on the values of species
+quantities. In particular, the viscosity is given by
+%
+\begin{equation}
+\mu = \sum_{s=1}^{N_s} \mu_s \frac{X_s}{\phi_s}
+\end{equation}
+%
+and the thermal conductivity is given by
+%
+\begin{equation}
+k = \sum_{s=1}^{N_s} k_s \frac{X_s}{\phi_s}
+\end{equation}
+%
+where $\phi_s$ is given by
+%
+\begin{equation}
+\phi_s = \sum_{t=1}^{N_s} X_t \frac{ \left(1 +
+  \sqrt{\frac{\mu_s}{\mu_t}}\sqrt[4]{\frac{M_t}{M_s}}\right)^2}{\sqrt{8\left(
+1+ \frac{M_s}{M_t}\right)}}
+\end{equation}
+%
+The species properties $\mu_s$ and $k_s$ are discusste in
+Section~\ref{sec:species-trans}.

+%=======================================================================
+% Kinetics
+%=======================================================================
+The rate of production/destruction of the individual species,
+$\dot{\omega}_s$, is required to close the species continuity
+equations.  These rates are computed using principles from the theory
+of chemical kinetics. In particular, the net production rate of each
+species is determined by a set of $r$ reactions.
+Each of these $r$ reactions is of the canonical form
+\begin{align}
+  \mathcal{R}_r &= \mathcal{R}_{b,r} - \mathcal{R}_{f,r} \\ &= k_{b,r}
+  \prod_{s=1}^{N_s} \left(\frac{\rho_s}{M_s}\right)^{\beta_{sr}} -
+  k_{f,r} \prod_{s=1}^{N_s}
+  \left(\frac{\rho_s}{M_s}\right)^{\alpha_{sr}}
+\end{align}
+where $k_{fr}$ and $k_{br}$ are the forward and backward reactions
+rates, respectively while $\alpha_{sr}$ and $\beta_{sr}$ are the
+stoichiometric coefficients for reactants and products of species $s$.
+The source terms can then be expressed in the canonical form
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \dot{\omega}_s = M_s \sum_{r=1}^{nr}\left(\beta_{sr}-\alpha_{sr}\right)\left(\mathcal{R}_{f,r} - \mathcal{R}_{b,r}\right)
+\end{equation}
+%
+where $nr$ is the number of reactions.
+The forward rate coefficients are expressed in a modified Arrhenius form as
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \label{eq:k_fr}
+  k_{f,r}\left(T\right) = A_{r} T^{\eta_r} \exp \left(-E_{r}/RT\right)
+\end{equation}
+%
+where
+$C_{fr}$ is the reaction rate constant, $\eta_r$ is the so-called pre-exponential factor, and $E_{ar}$ is the activation energy.
+The three constants are determined from curve fits to experimental data.
 
-\noindent Where $\rho$ is the density, $u$ is the velocity, $p_0$ is the constant thermodynamic pressure, $T$ is the temperature, $p$ is the mechanical pressure,  $\tau$ is the stress tensor, and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity.   We define the nondimensional quantities by:\\
+%
+The backward rate coefficient can be found using the principle of detailed balance, which states
+\begin{equation}
+  \label{eq:k_br}
+  K_{eq,r} = \frac{k_{f,r}\left(T\right)}{k_{b,r}\left(T\right)}
+\end{equation}
+%
+where $K_{eq}$ is the equilibrium constant and may be obtained through Gibbs' free energy minimization. Specifically, for reaction $r$ we have
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \label{eq:k_eq}
+  K_{eq,r}\left(T\right) =
+  \left(\frac{P_0}{RT}\right)^{\nu_r}\exp\left[-\sum_s\left(\beta_{sr}-\alpha_{sr}\right)\left(\frac{H^\circ_s}{RT} - \frac{S^\circ_s}{R}\right)\right]
+\end{equation}
+%
+where $P_0= 10^5 [Pa]$ is the standard reference pressure,
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \nu_r \equiv \sum_s\left(\beta_{sr}-\alpha_{sr}\right)
+\end{equation}
+%
+and the normalized enthalpy, $H^{\circ_s}/RT$, and entropy, $S^{\circ_s}/R$, data are available from curve fit data~\cite{CEATables}.

-The kinetic theory\cite{Curtiss} uses the assumption of the ideal gas law.
- 
-$$pv = nRT$$ Where $p$ is the pressure, $v$ is the volume, $n$ is the number of moles of the gas, $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the temperature. The viscocity of the species is given by the following formula
+%% \begin{figure}[H]

+\section{One-Dimensional Approximation}\label{sec:1d}
 
-$$D_{ij} = \frac{3}{16}\sqrt{\frac{2 k_B^3 T^3}{\pi m_{ij}}}\frac{f_n}{{ P \sigma_{ij}}^2   \Omega^{(1,1^*)}}$$
+It is common to use a one-dimensional approximation to predict
+temperature and species profiles in a so-called ``free flame''
+configuration. Thus, we affix the $x$-coordinate to the frame of the
+flame and assume a steady state configuration. Then,
+following~\cite{Smooke}, we have the following system of equations:
+%
+\begin{align}
+  \dot{M} &= \rho u = \text{constant}\label{eq:mdot}\\
+  \dot{M} \frac{dY_s}{dx} &= -\frac{d}{dx}\left( \rho Y_s V_s\right) +

+  c_p \dot{M} \frac{dT}{dx} &= \frac{d}{dx}\left( k \frac{dT}{dx}
+  \right) - \frac{dT}{dx}\sum_{s=1}^{N_s} \rho Y_s V_s c_{p,s}  -
+  \sum_{s=1}^{N_s} h_s \dot{\omega}_s \\
+   p_0 &= \rho R T
+\end{align}
+%
+where all quantities have been defined in
+Section~\ref{sec:lowmach}.

-\begin{equation}
-m_{ij} = \left\{\begin{array}{l@{\qquad}l}
-                \frac{m_i m_j}{m_i + m_j} &  i \neq j \\
-                m_i                                  & i=j
-                    \end{array}
-              \right.
-\end{equation}
+Boundary conditions are specified at $x =
+\pm \infty$. In particular,
+%
+\begin{align}
+  T(-\infty) &= T_0 \\
+  Y_s(-\infty) &= Y_{s,0}, \quad s = 1,\dots,N_s
+\end{align}
+%
+and
+%
+\begin{align}
+  \frac{dT}{dx}(\infty) &= 0 \\
+  \frac{dY_s}{dx}(\infty) &= 0, \quad s = 1,\dots,N_s
+\end{align}
+%
+Once $\dot{M}$ is computed, the flame speed can be directly calculated
+using the inlet conditions to compute the density at the inlet.
+Note that $\dot{M}$ is effectively an eigenvalue for this problem.
+Theoretically, once could use, say, chemical equilibrium at
+$x=\infty$, or zero derivatives at $x=-\infty$ to enforce
+Equation~\eqref{eq:mdot}. Computationally, the condition is handled
+differently in practice.

+\subsection{Numerical Approximation}
 
-\noindent The thermal conductivity of the mixture is given by Wilke rule\cite{Wilke}given by 
+The first approximation is that the infinite domain is truncated to a
+finite length, $x\in[0,L]$. $L$ must be sufficiently large to not
+significantly influence the solution. Next, the boundary conditions
+become
+%
+\begin{align}
+  T(0) &= T_0 \\
+  \varepsilon_s(0) &= Y_{s,0}, \quad s = 1, \dots, N_s
+\end{align}
+%
+where $\varepsilon_s$ is the mass flux fraction of species $s$:
+%
 \begin{equation}
-\lambda_{\textnormal{mixture}} = \sum_{s=1}^{n} \frac {x_i \lambda_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \Phi_{ij}}
+  \varepsilon_s = Y_s + \frac{\rho Y_s V_s}{\dot{M}}, \quad s = 1, \dots, N_s
 \end{equation}
-\noindent  We have varied temperature from 300 K to 2700 K and plotted the mixture thermal conductivity V/s Temperature for all the  three species.  We have considered three cases-  behind the flame where condentration of $O_3$,$O_2$ and $O$ are taken to be .53, .47 and 0 respectively. Second case of the inside of the flame where concentrations are 0.5, 0.4 and 0.1 respectively. The third case is of the behind the flame where ozone and oxygen radical are absent and there will be only $O_2$. The $\sigma$ values and constants for dimensionless collision number are taken from GriMech 3.0\cite{gri}.

+This condition is preferred for the inlet boundary condition to ensure
+the proper mass flow since the domain has been truncated.
+The outlet boundary conditions remain the same:
+%
+\begin{align}
+  \frac{dT}{dx}(L) &= 0 \\
+  \frac{dY_s}{dx}(L) &= 0, \quad s = 1, \dots, N_s
+\end{align}
+%
+Finally, to treat the eigenvalue $\dot{M}$, an trivial auxillary
+differential equation is introduced:
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  \frac{d\dot{M}}{dx} = 0
+\end{equation}
+%
+The choice made in~\cite{Smooke} is to specify the temperature at an
+interior point:
+%
+\begin{equation}
+  T(x_f) = T_f
+\end{equation}
+%
+where $x_f$ and $T_f$ are user-specified parameters. Smooke et
+al~\cite{Smooke} note that the convergence of the iterative procedure
+can be particularly sensitive to these choices.

-We shall use Heimerl and coffee's\cite{Heimerl} contemporary method for modelling combustion flame problem. A one dimensional, premixed, laminar, steady state ozone oxygen flame was considered in their theortical model. The reason for choosing this model was due to its simplicity. The chemical reactions involve only three species:
+Following~\cite{Smooke}, the nonlinear boundary value problem is discretized using an upwind
+finite difference approximation. The initial profiles are based on
+cubic Hermite functions for temperature and major species and Gaussian
+profiles for minor species; chemical equilibrium is used to provide
+the initial guess for species post-flame. Newton's method with line
+search~\cite{NocedalWright1999} is used to solve the resulting system
+of nonlinear equations.
 
+\subsection{Software Infrastructure}
 
-			$$O_3 + M \rightleftharpoons O + O_2 + M $$
-			$$ O + O_3 \rightleftharpoons  2O_2$$ 
-			$$ 2O + M \rightleftharpoons O_2 + M$$
-\noindent Where M represents the third body which could be either $O$, $O_2$ or $O_3$. 
+The numerical scheme described previously has been deployed in the
+Cantera software package~\cite{Cantera}. The Cantera C++ code provides
+implementations for the thermodynamic, transport, and chemical
+kinetics models described previously. Further, Cantera provides an
+interface for computing solutions to the one-dimensional free flame
+problem described previously. The only variation is that Cantera will
+use simple time-stepping schemes to aid in obtaining a better initial
+guess for the steady-state nonlinear solve. We have used Cantera
+version 2.1.2 in this work.
 
 
-\subsection{The experimental data on laminar flame speed}
 
-\noindent A.G Streng and A.V. Grosse\cite{Streng}  studied the ozone oxygen flame experimentally. The stability of ozone and the rates of decomposition or explosion were investigated by Armour research foundation. Ozone was burned to oxygen from a simple burner tip in the range from 17 percent to 100 percent initial concentration of ozone in the mixture. The flame temperatures were calculated from enthalpy data and dissociation constants of oxygen using kelley's tables. The concentration of ozone was kept constant with error of   0.2 percent. Two methods were used to determine burning velocity i.e open tube method and the burning tip method. We will be using experimental burning velocity of the burning tip method. The burner tip experiments were carried out in standard apparatus, using pyrex glass aluminium tips with an inner diameter of 3 to 0.65mm. The flames were readily observed by the standard schlieren method at all concentrations above 30 mole percent. The measurements were all carried out in the laminar flow region and the reynolds number of the flow was below 2000. The initial conditions are 300K temperature and 1.0 atmosphere pressure. The results of burning velocities of ozone flames were compared with theoretical burning velocities of Dr. Von Karman and his associates. They were found to be in close agreements.

They have shown that laminar flame speed or burning velocity varies with the initial concentration of the ozone. The table given below shows the burning velocity with respect to initial concentration of the ozone. We concentrate on two speciifc cases where initial concentration of ozone is 53 percent and 100 percent. The laminar flame speed for 53 percent is measured in the burner with inner diameter 1.3mm  and rate of 7.7 cc/sec. The laminar flame speed for 100 percent ozone is taken on .66 inner diameter tip 0.66 mm and the flow rate of 8.23 cc/sec. 
-The measured laminar flame speed is given below. Laminar flame measurements are carried out at 300K and 1 atmosphere pressure. 
+			$$O_3 + M \rightleftharpoons O + O_2 + M $$
+			$$ O + O_3 \rightleftharpoons 2O_2$$

-\section{Governing Equations}
-
-
-The final equations obtained by from asymptotic analysis is given below. 
-\begin{eqnarray}
--\nabla \cdot u &=& \frac{1}{p^0} \frac{d p^0}{d t} - \frac{1}{T}\frac{D T}{D t} \hspace{1mm}\\
-\rho \frac{D u}{D t} \hspace{1mm} &=& -\frac{1}{M^2}\hspace{1mm}\nabla p\hspace{1mm}+\hspace{1mm}\frac{1}{Re}\nabla \cdot \tau + \frac{1}{Fr^2}\rho g \\
-\rho C_p \frac{D T}{D t} \hspace{1mm}&=&\hspace{1mm} -  \frac{1}{Re Pr}\nabla\cdot (k \nabla T) + \hspace{1mm} \frac{1}{\gamma -1} \frac{d p^0}{d t}\hspace{1mm}\\
-\end{eqnarray}
-
-\noindent Where $\rho$ is the density, $u$ is the velocity, $p_0$ is the constant thermodynamic pressure, $T$ is the temperature, $p$ is the mechanical pressure,  $\tau$ is the stress tensor, and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity.   We define the nondimensional quantities by:\\
-
-\bigskip
-
-$\rho = \frac{\rho^*}{\rho_\infty} $, $p = \frac{p^*}{p_\infty} $, $u = \frac{u^*}{u_\infty} $, $T = \frac{T^*}{T_\infty} $, $\mu = \frac{\mu^*}{\mu_\infty} $, $k = \frac{k^*}{k_\infty} $,$x = \frac{x^*}{L^*} $, $t = \frac{t^*}{L^*/u^*_{\infty}} $, $\beta^* = \frac{\beta}{\beta_{\infty}} $, 
-\bigskip
-
-$C_p^* = \frac{C_p}{{C_p}^*_{\infty}}$.
-
-\noindent The species conservation equation is given as 
-\begin{eqnarray}
-	\frac{\partial \rho_i}{\partial t} + \nabla . (\rho_i v) &= \nabla . (\rho D_{i} \nabla Y_i) + \dot{w_i}
-\end{eqnarray}
-\noindent where, $Y_i$ is the mass fraction of the ith species, $D_i$ is the bimolecular diffusion coefficient which is caluclated as per mixture model in transport model section, the rate of production for species $i$ is given by
-	
-Where $$\dot{w_i} = MW_i \sum_{k=1}^{6}(v_{k,i}^{''} - v_{k,i}^{'}) B_k T^{\alpha_k} e^{\frac{-E_a}{R_u T}} \prod_{j=1}^3 \left(\frac{X_j p}{R T} \right)^{v'_{j,k}}$$
-
-\noindent The above equation considers all reactions for all the species. $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R_u$ is the universal gas constant, $X_j$ is the molar concentration of the reactant j, $Mw_i$ is the molecular weight of the reactant. $v'_{j,k}$ is the moles of reactant j in the reaction k. $v''_{j,k}$ is the number of moles of product. 
-
-\noindent From atomic species conservation 
-	$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} v_i{'}M_i \rightleftharpoons \sum_{i=1}^{N} v_i{''}M_i $$
-\noindent Where $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R_u$ is the universal gas constant, $X_j$ is the molar concentration of the reactant j, $Mw_i$ is the molecular weight of the reactant. $v'_{j,k}$ is the moles of reactant j in the reaction k. $v''_{j,k}$ is the number of moles of product. 
-
-\bigskip
-
-\noindent The overall continuity equation, species conservation equation and energy conservation equation are solved to calculate the flame parameters. For many cases, $P_0$ is constant. The viscous dissipation is negligible and there is no body force work. 
-
-\noindent The Diffusion equation is given 
-\begin{eqnarray}
-\frac{\partial X_k}{\partial x} &= \sum_{j=1}^{3} \frac{X_k X_j}{D_{jk}} (V_j - V_k)
-\end{eqnarray}
-
-\noindent Where $D_{jk}$ is the fick's diffusion coefficient. $V$ is the diffusion velocities. We make following assumptions about our combustion model 
-
-\begin{itemize}
-\item Reacting fluid is continuous
-\item Ideal gas law is valid
-\item Lewis, Schmidt, and Prandtl numbers are equal to 1. 
-\item Equal mass diffusivities of all species
-\item Fick's  law of diffusion is valid
-\item Constant specific heat of the  gas phase
-\item Uniform pressure for low speed combustion flows
-\item Dufor and Soret effects are negligible
-\item Negligible combustion generated turbulence
-\end{itemize}
-
-
-\noindent The boundaries are defined by specifying the concentration of $O_3$, $O_2$ at the inlet.

-\section{1D oxygen ozone combustion model}
-
-\noindent The governing equations are givenin one dimensional and time dependent forms as follows from principles of combustion by Kuo.  
-
-The Overall continuity equation is given as
-\begin{eqnarray}
-\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} +  \frac{\partial \rho u }{\partial x} &= 0
-\end{eqnarray}
-
-The species continuity equation
-
-\begin{eqnarray}
-\rho \frac{Y_k}{\partial t} + \rho u \frac{Y_k}{\partial x} &= -\frac{\partial (\rho Y_k V_k)}{\partial x}  + w_k
-\end{eqnarray}
-
-\noindent Where $k = 1, 2$ or  $3$ for $O$, $O_2$ or $O_3$ respectively. 
-
-Energy Equation 
-
-\begin{eqnarray}
-\rho C_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \rho u C_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} &= \frac{\partial }{\partial x} \left(\lambda \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right)  - \sum_{k=1}^{N} w_k \Delta h^0_{fk} - \rho  \sum_{k=1}^{N} C_{p,k} Y_k V_k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}
-\end{eqnarray}
-
-\noindent This energy equations was arrived at under assumption that the pressure is constant in the reaction zone, the viscous dissipation is negligible, and there is no body force. 
-
-\noindent The Diffusion equation is given as 
-\begin{eqnarray}
-\frac{\partial X_k}{\partial x} &= \sum_{j=1}^{3} \frac{X_k X_j}{D_{jk}} (V_j - V_k)
-\end{eqnarray}
-
-\noindent We have considered a free flame in a tube. In this configuration, there is a premixed mixture of fuel and oxidiser in given concentration. The spark is generated at a random point in the domain. The flae is developed anf it burns through the whole mixture untill all fuel is converted to oxygen. The boundary conditions for the totally burned end are 
-
-$$x \leftarrow \infty:  \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial Y_k}{\partial x} = 0$$
-
-\noindent In order to avoid solving the continuity equation along with the other equations, Heirmerl and coffee\cite{Heimerl} used a langrangian coordinate $\psi$
-and a new time coordinate $\tau$ defined by 
-
-$$\psi \equiv \int_{0}^{x} \rho(x',t)dx'$$
-
-\noindent So by definiton of $\psi$ and by chain, we have these expressions
- $$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = \rho$$
- $$\frac{\partial \tau}{\partial x} = 0$$
- $$\frac{\partial \tau}{\partial t} = 1$$
- $$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = (\rho u)_{x=0} - (\rho u)_{x} $$
-
-\noindent By integrating the overall continuity equation from 0 to x, we obtain 
-
-$$\frac{\partial d}{\partial t} \int_{0}^{x} \rho dx + [(\rho u)_{x} - (\rho u)_{0} ] = 0$$ 
-
-\noindent The product $\rho u$ at $x =0$ is the eigenvalue of the problem. It is defined as 
-
-$$m_0 = (\rho u)_0$$
-
-\noindent The energy equation in the new coordinate system becomes 
-
-\begin{eqnarray}
- \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + m_0 \frac{T}{\partial \psi} &= \frac{1}{C_p}\frac{d}{\partial \psi} \left(\rho \lambda \frac{\partial T}{\partial \psi}\right)  - \frac{1}{\rho C_p} \sum_{k=1}^{N} w_k \Delta h^0_{fk} - \frac{1}{C_p}  \sum_{k=1}^{N} C_{p,k} Y_k V_k \frac{\partial T}{\partial \psi}
-\end{eqnarray}
-
-\noindent The eigenvalue of $m_0$ or $S_L$ was determined from the steady state solution of the problem, that is 
-
-$$\frac{\partial Y_k}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = 0$$
-
-\noindent Under the steady state conditons,
-
-$$\rho u = constant = \rho_\infty u_\infty = -\rho_1 S_L$$
-
-\subsection{Numerical solution software: Cantera/2.1.2 }
-
-\noindent We have used cantera/2.1.2 for our ozone combustion model. The software uses newton's method and tries to find the steady state solution. Once the steady state is reached, it calculates the laminar flame speed. 
- 
- \bigskip
- 
-\section{Transport Model}
-\subsection{Viscocity}
-\noindent We have used viscosity model as derived from kinetics theory under the ideal gas assumption
-The kinetic theory\cite{Curtiss} uses the assumption of the ideal gas law.
- 
-$$pv = nRT$$ Where $p$ is the pressure, $v$ is the volume, $n$ is the number of moles of the gas, $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the temperature. The viscocity of the species is given by the following formula
-
-$$\eta_s = \frac{5}{16}\sqrt{\frac{m_s k_B T}{\pi}}\frac{f_n}{{\sigma_s}^2   \Omega^{(2,2^*)}}$$
-
-\noindent Where  $m$ the molecular mass of the species (kg), $\sigma$ is the Lennard-Jones potential diameter associated
-to the species $(m)$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant,$\Omega^{(2,2^*)}$ is the value of the dimensionless integrated integral value determined by a quadratic interpolations of tables based on Stockmayer potntials given in from Monchick
-and Mason\cite{Monchick}. With hard sphere approximation $f_n = 1$. We have three species in our system i.e $O$, $O_2$ and $O_3$. We have varied temperature from 300 K to 2700 K and plotted the viscocity V/s Temperature for all the three species. The $\sigma$ values and constants for dimensionless collision number are taken from GriMech 3.0.

-\subsection{Bimolecular Diffusion}
-\noindent The molecular binary diffusion model is
-computed from kinetics theory, assuming an ideal gas. The molecular binary diffusion\cite{Curtiss} coefficient ($m^2 s^{-1}$ ) is given by:
-
-$$D_{ij} = \frac{3}{16}\sqrt{\frac{2 k_B^3 T^3}{\pi m_{ij}}}\frac{f_n}{{ P \sigma_{ij}}^2   \Omega^{(1,1^*)}}$$
-
-with  the reduced mass
-\begin{equation}
-m_{ij} = \left\{\begin{array}{l@{\qquad}l}
-                \frac{m_i m_j}{m_i + m_j} &  i \neq j \\
-                m_i                                  & i=j
-                    \end{array}
-              \right.
-\end{equation}
-
-$\sigma_{ij}$ is the Lennard-Jones collision diameter between species $i$ and $j$:
-\begin{equation}
-\sigma_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma_i + \sigma_j\right) \xi^{-\frac{1}{6}}
-\end{equation}
-
-\noindent and $\Omega^{(1,1^*)}$ the integrated collision interval, fitted from the tables given in Monchick and Mason \cite{Monchick}. We have varied temperature from 300 K to 2700 K and plotted the Diffusion coefficient for all the combination of three species.The $\sigma$ values and constants for dimensionless collision number are taken from GriMech 3.0.

- \section{Premixed ozone combustion model}
-We shall use Heimerl and coffee's\cite{Heimerl} contemporary method for modelling combustion flame problem. A one dimensional, premixed, laminar, steady state ozone oxygen flame was considered in their theortical model. The reason for choosing this model was due to its simplicity. The chemical reactions involve only three species:
-
-
-			$$O_3 + M \rightleftharpoons O + O_2 + M $$
-			$$ O + O_3 \rightleftharpoons  2O_2$$ 
-			$$ 2O + M \rightleftharpoons O_2 + M$$
-\noindent Where M represents the third body which could be either $O$, $O_2$ or $O_3$.

-\subsection{The experimental data on laminar flame speed}
-
-\noindent A.G Streng and A.V. Grosse\cite{Streng}  studied the ozone oxygen flame experimentally. The stability of ozone and the rates of decomposition or explosion were investigated by Armour research foundation. Ozone was burned to oxygen from a simple burner tip in the range from 17 percent to 100 percent initial concentration of ozone in the mixture. The flame temperatures were calculated from enthalpy data and dissociation constants of oxygen using kelley's tables. The concentration of ozone was kept constant with error of   0.2 percent. Two methods were used to determine burning velocity i.e open tube method and the burning tip method. We will be using experimental burning velocity of the burning tip method. The burner tip experiments were carried out in standard apparatus, using pyrex glass aluminium tips with an inner diameter of 3 to 0.65mm. The flames were readily observed by the standard schlieren method at all concentrations above 30 mole percent. The measurements were all carried out in the laminar flow region and the reynolds number of the flow was below 2000. The initial conditions are 300K temperature and 1.0 atmosphere pressure. The results of burning velocities of ozone flames were compared with theoretical burning velocities of Dr. Von Karman and his associates. They were found to be in close agreements. 
-
-
-\noindent To compare our results, we have used the experimental data given by the A.G.  streng\cite{Streng} and A.V. Grosse, They have done experiments with ozone flame in tube and ozone flame on the tip of the burner. We will be using the results of the later. They have shown that laminar flame speed or burning velocity varies with the initial concentration of the ozone. The table given below shows the burning velocity with respect to initial concentration of the ozone. We concentrate on two speciifc cases where initial concentration of ozone is 53 percent and 100 percent. The laminar flame speed for 53 percent is measured in the burner with inner diameter 1.3mm  and rate of 7.7 cc/sec. The laminar flame speed for 100 percent ozone is taken on .66 inner diameter tip 0.66 mm and the flow rate of 8.23 cc/sec. 
-The measured laminar flame speed is given below. Laminar flame measurements are carried out at 300K and 1 atmosphere pressure.

-\chapter{Conclusion}
+\noindent In this work we have attempted to study the uncertainty involved in the chemical parameters in an ozone mechanism. We have considered one dimensional flow and used Bayesian inteference to infer the chemical parameters involved in the reaction. We have considered those parameters which are most sensitive to the calculation of flamespeed. In different models, We have proved the convergence of the surrogates and  number of MCMC samples. As a sanity check, We have ensured that the samples which we are drawing actually fitting the data of flamespeed from the experiments of Streng\cite{Streng}. Finally we have studied the mean and autocorrelation plots for the distribution.

+\noindent We have seen that more number of surrogate points are required to obtain better probability distribution distribution for parameters. Also we need more MCMC samples to get better statistical results. As we increase the domain size for the parameters, we encounter numerical difficulties for our forward run. The newton iterations do not converge. Investigations need to be done for $20 \% $and $ 28 \% $ percent ozone case. There is numerical difficulties for calculating the flame speed for these cases.

 \chapter{Introduction}
 
 \section{Motivation}
-It is important to understand the dynamics of reacting flows as it is inherent in number of areas of science and engineering such as combustion, surface chemistry, and reentry flows . To understand these systems in detail, it is necessary to use numerical simulations. These simulations require simultaneous numerical resolution of chemical reactions, diffusive transport, and fluid mechanics. The combination of these three factors make simulations demanding of computational resources. The problem is acute in the deflagration regime where the burning speed, also known as laminar flame speed and associated velocity scales are much smaller than the speed of sound in the fluid.

-\noindent  We need models that provide predictive and explanatory power. These models should be complex enough to explain the observed phenomena. Also, these models should be simple enough to generalize to future observations. These models inevitably contain unknown parameters that must be caliberated against experimental data. Traditionally, optimization approaches have been used. However, such a deterministic approaches fail to incorporate information about the uncertainty in the data. Bayesian inference provides a systematic framework to infer such parameters from the observed data and in particular provides a systematic approach to incorporate uncertainty. 
-In this work, We aim at performing Bayesian inference for chemical parameters in an ozone combustion model. Experiments\cite{Streng} have successfully measured the flamespeed for premixed ozone oxygen   fuel at various concentrations starting from  17 percent ozone to 100 percent ozone. We use this data in our model and try to infer the chemical parameters that would fit this data. In Bayesian approach, we take into consideration our prior knowledge about the parameters and the likelihood of observing the data given the parameters. The resulting answer is the probability distribution of the parameters given the data.

-\bigskip
-\noindent In this work, we begin with mathematical model for the reacting flows in the first section. In this section, we use 1D combustion model from the principles of combustion by kuo. We describe the transport model which we we are using for the calculations of kinetic rates, viscocity, and diffusion rates. In next section we do Bayesian inference of the chemical parameters. We describe different models used by us during the entire analysis. We also describe the method of solutions adopted by us for solving the inverse problem. In secton 4, we plot the results of the inverse problem for the models decribed in section 3. In secton 5, we develop finite element model for 2D premixed laminar flames. Here we describe about the stabilization techniques used and lay the foundation for future Bayesian inference for the chemical parameters for 2D flames.

-It is shown by Muller~\cite{Muller} that a multiple-time scale, single-space scale asymptotic analysis of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations reveals that the zeroth-order global thermodynamic pressure, the divergence of velocity; and the material change of density are affected by heat-release rate and heat conduction at low-Mach-numbers.

-\noindent His result show that the acoustic time change of the heat-release rate as the dominant source of sound in low-Mach-number flow. The asymptotic expansion of all flow variables show that the viscous and buoyancy forces enter the computation of the second-order incompressible pressure in low-Mach-number flow in a similar way as they enter the pressure computation in incompressible flow, except that the
-velocity-divergence constraint is non zero. He averaged flow equation over an acoustic wave period, the averaged velocity tensor described the net acoustic effect on the averaged flow field. Once acoustics were removed from the equations altogether it lead to the low-Mach-number equations.

-\noindent The Laminar flame speed is the important property of a reacting mixture. The laminar flame velocity is defined as the velocity of the unburned gases throught the combustion wave in the direction normal to the wave surface. 
 
-\noindent The one of the first techniques to measure the laminar flame speeds is the bunsen burner technique. Approximating the conical surface area of the innermost cone, the cross sectional area of the burner tube, and the average flow velocty in the tube, Laminar flame speed could be calculated. However the accuracy obtained by this method is of $\pm $ 20 \% according to Kuo\cite{Kuo}. The next method of calculating the flame speed is the burning the mixture of oxygen and fuel in a tube. This method is known as constant volume spherical bomb method\cite{Kuo}. The time variation of instantaneous mass of unburned gas is propotional to the change of pressure and change of spherical flame radius with respect to time. The flame speed is calculated as a difference in the two time derivatives. The disadvantage of this method is that error in the time deivative can be magnified in calculations of laminar flame speed.

At time zero, the gas mixture contained in the spherical soap bubble is ignited by spark. From the average spatial velocity of the spherical flame front, the initial radius of the soap bubble and the final radius of the sphere of the burned gases, the laminar flamespeed is calculated. The initial and final sizes of the bubble must be known very accurately. The method is not suitable for studying the flame spread of dry mixtures. There is heat loss due to electrodes.

-\noindent Lewis and von Elbe\cite{lewis} used rectangular burners. They devised a particle track method in which small magnesium oxide particles in gas stream were illuminated interittently from the sides. A photograph of the particle shows its direction and the velocity of the particle can be deduced from consecutive photographs. The disdvantage of this method is that the added particles ay bring about the catalytic change in the combustion processes and hence change the laminar flame speed.

-\noindent Powling\cite{powling} invented the flat flame burner method. It is most accurate method due to a very simple flame front. The area of shadow, schlieren, and visible fronts are all the same. The gaseous mixture is usually ignited at high flow rate and adjusted untill the flame is flat. This method is applicable only to the mixtures having low burning velocities. Spalding and Botha\cite{splading} extended flat flame burner method to higher flame speeds by cooling the porous disk which brings flame front closer to the disk. The values of flame speed are plotted at different cooling rates. The curve is then extrapolated to zero cooling rate to obtain adiabatic flame speed.

-\noindent The evaluation of laminar flame speed is important due to two important reason. First is that, laminar flame speed is the key input parameter of various models of premixed turbulent combustion. Secondly, data on laminar flames are widely used to access detailed and semi detailed chemical mechanisms of combustion of various fuels. Thus to design engine, to model turbulent combustion and for validation of chemical kinetics it is necessray to have an accurate knowledge of the laminar flame speeds. Over the years, reported values of laminar flame speeds have been characterised by substantial scatter\cite{Andrews}. This scatter is observed because it is not poosible to generate 1D planar, adiabatic, steady laminar flames for which flame speed is defined. Most of the flames are stabilized by heat loss and curvature. The counterflow technique introduced by  Law and co-workers\cite{law} gave laminar flame speeds that are used extensively for the validation of chemical kinetics and modeling of turbulent combustion. In this work, it is necessary to take measurements at low strain rates so that linear extrapolation to zero strain rate produces accurate values of laminar flame speed. Dixon \cite{dixon} and Tien\cite{tien} showed that extrapolations can lead to over prediction if true value of laminar flame speed.  
 
+\noindent The evaluation of laminar flame speed is important due to
+two important reason. First is that, laminar flame speed is the key
+input parameter of various models of premixed turbulent
+combustion. Secondly, data on laminar flames are widely used to access
+detailed and semi detailed chemical mechanisms of combustion of
+various fuels. Thus to design engine, to model turbulent combustion
+and for validation of chemical kinetics it is necessray to have an
+accurate knowledge of the laminar flame speeds. Over the years,
+reported values of laminar flame speeds have been characterised by
+substantial scatter\cite{Andrews}. This scatter is observed because it
+is not poosible to generate 1D planar, adiabatic, steady laminar
+flames for which flame speed is defined. Most of the flames are
+stabilized by heat loss and curvature. The counterflow technique
+introduced by Law and co-workers\cite{law} gave laminar flame speeds
+that are used extensively for the validation of chemical kinetics and
+modeling of turbulent combustion. In this work, it is necessary to
+take measurements at low strain rates so that linear extrapolation to
+zero strain rate produces accurate values of laminar flame
+speed. Dixon \cite{dixon} and Tien\cite{tien} showed that
+extrapolations can lead to over prediction if true value of laminar
+flame speed.

-\section{Model 1: $E_3$}
-
-The results displayed in this section are for the uncertainty involved in the calculation of flamespeed depending only on one parameter i.e the activation energy for the fall off reaction in the ozone mechanism. The percentage of ozone is taken as 40,46,53,75 and 100  percent acccording to the experimental data available to us from Streng\cite{Streng}.The results are displayed in five sections. In first section, the plots are shown for raw chain size, histogram, CDF and log likelihood for parameter $E_3$. In second section, for constant surrogate size, the number of samples are changed from 1e5 to 1e7 and convergence is observed. In the third part of the results, convergence study is done for surrogates with different sizes. In fourth section, we ensure that samples of the parameter which we are drawing are fitting the flamespeed values of the experiment. Also for varying size the map point of the resulting pdf does not change greatly. In the fifth section mean and correlation plots are shown for the samples of the parameter. The surrogates for individual concentrations are constructed using linear interpolation function. The initial guess for the map point is calculated using nelder mead optimization technique. After supplying initial guess over large domain it is found that the map point is the same no matter where we start our guess. 
-
-\subsection{ Statistics }
-
-\noindent In this section, we display results for sample size 1e7 and surrogate of 1000 points. We show the raw samples generated by MCMC and plot the histogram for the same. Later we plot the kde and cdf. The last plot shows the log of the likelihood function. We can clearly see the burning period for the samples.

-\subsection{Convergence Study- Number of samples }
-
-\noindent In this section, we see the convergence of the probability distribution as we increase the raw chain sample size. The plot is done for surrogate size of 1000. In this analysis, raw chain size of $1e5$, $5e5$ , $1e6$, $5e6$ and $1e7$ is taken.

-\subsection{Convergence Study- Surrogate }
-
-\noindent In this section, we see the convergence of the surrogate. As we increase the number of points in the surrogate, results should be close for different surrogate sizes. The plot is done for surrogate size of 100, 500 and 1000. In this analysis, raw sample chain size is $1e7$.

-\subsection{Flamespeed Data fit}
-
-\noindent It is necessary to ensure that the samples of the parameter which we are drawing are fitting the flamespeed values of the experiment. In this section, we calculate the flamespeed for all the parameters drawn using the surrogate generated before. We have taken $1e7$ sample size and calculated flamespeed for different concentrations of ozone.

-\subsection{Mean and Autocorrelation plots}
-
-\noindent In this section, we show the mean of the samples and autocorrelation plots . The mean plot shows the initial instability due to burning period of MCMC and after that it remains constant. It shows us that we should be using atleast more than these number of samples for our analysis. The last figure shows the histogram and the various parameters of the distribution are Mean:  28.2637996517, Std. Dev.:  0.781544249521, Skewness:  0.0666128926966 and Kurtosis:  0.035161943845

-\section{Model 2: $E_2$ and $E_3$}
-
-The results displayed in this section are for the uncertainty involved in the calculation of flamespeed depending  on two parameter i.e the activation energy for the fall off reaction in the ozone mechanism and activation energy for second reaction in the mechanism. The percentage of ozone is taken as 40,46,53,75 and 100  percent acccording to the experimental data available to us from Streng\cite{Streng}.The results are displayed in five sections. In first section, the plots are shown for raw chain size, histogram, and CDF for parameters $E_3$ and $E_2$. In second section, for constant surrogate size, the number of samples are changed from 1e5 to 1e7 and convergence is observed. In the third part of the results, convergence study is done for surrogates with different sizes. In fourth section, we ensure that samples of the parameter which we are drawing are fitting the flamespeed values of the experiment. In the fifth section mean and correlation plots are shown for the samples of both the parameters. The surrogates for individual concentrations are constructed using linear interpolation function. The initial guess for the map point is calculated using nelder mead optimization technique. After supplying initial guess over large domain it is found that the map point is the same no matter where we start our guess.

-
-\subsection{ Statistics }
-
-\noindent In this section, we display results for sample size 1e7 and surrogate of 100*100 points. We  have plotted the kde.

-
-\subsection{Convergence Study- Number of samples }
-
-\noindent In this section, we see the convergence of the probability distribution as we increase the raw chain sample size. The plot is done for surrogate size of 100. In this analysis, raw chain size of $1e5$, $5e5$ , $1e6$, $5e6$ and $1e7$ is taken.

-
-\subsection{Convergence Study- Surrogate }
-
-\noindent In this section, we see the convergence of the surrogate. As we increase the number of points in the surrogate, results should be close for different surrogate sizes. The plot is done for surrogate size of 100, 500 and 1000. In this analysis, raw sample chain size is $1e7$.

-\subsection{Flamespeed Data fit}
-
-\noindent It is necessary to ensure that the samples of the parameter which we are drawing are fitting the flamespeed values of the experiment. In this section, we calculate the flamespeed for all the parameters drawn using the surrogate generated before. We have taken $1e7$ sample size and calculated flamespeed for different concentrations of ozone.

-\subsection{Mean and Autocorrelation plots}
-
-\noindent In this section, we show the mean of the samples and autocorrelation plots . The mean plot shows the initial instability due to burning period of MCMC and after that it remains constant. It shows us that we should be using atleast more than these number of samples for our analysis.

-\section{Model 3: $A_3$ and $E_3$}
-
-The results displayed in this section are for the uncertainty involved in the calculation of flamespeed depending  on two parameter i.e the activation energy for the fall off reaction in the ozone mechanism and the pre exponential factor for third reaction in the mechanism. The percentage of ozone is taken as 40,46,53,75 and 100  percent acccording to the experimental data available to us from Streng\cite{Streng}.The results are displayed in four sections. In first section, for constant surrogate size, the number of samples are changed from 7e5 to 1e7 and convergence is observed. In the second part of the results, convergence study is done for surrogates with different sizes. In third section, we ensure that samples of the parameter which we are drawing are fitting the flamespeed values of the experiment. In the fourth section mean and correlation plots are shown for the samples of both the parameters. The surrogates for individual concentrations are constructed using linear interpolation function. The initial guess for the map point is calculated using nelder mead optimization technique. After supplying initial guess over large domain it is found that the map point is the same no matter where we start our guess.

-
-\noindent In this section, we display results for sample size 1e7 and surrogate of 100*100 points. We  have plotted the kde.

-\subsection{Convergence Study- Number of samples }
-
-\noindent In this section, we see the convergence of the probability distribution as we increase the raw chain sample size. The plot is done for surrogate size of 100. In this analysis, raw chain size of $1e5$, $5e5$ , $1e6$, $5e6$ and $1e7$ is taken.

-\subsection{Convergence Study- Surrogate }
-
-\noindent In this section, we see the convergence of the surrogate. As we increase the number of points in the surrogate, results should be close for different surrogate sizes. The plot is done for surrogate size of 100, 500 and 1000. In this analysis, raw sample chain size is $1e7$.

-\subsection{Flamespeed Data fit}
-
-\noindent It is necessary to ensure that the samples of the parameter which we are drawing are fitting the flamespeed values of the experiment. In this section, we calculate the flamespeed for all the parameters drawn using the surrogate generated before. We have taken $1e7$ sample size and calculated flamespeed for different concentrations of ozone.

-\subsection{Mean and Autocorrelation plots}
-
-\noindent In this section, we show the mean of the samples and autocorrelation plots . The mean plot shows the initial instability due to burning period of MCMC and after that it remains constant. It shows us that we should be using atleast more than these number of samples for our analysis.
